# Win32 API C++ Sample Code

This is my collection of C++ code to learn and train to code using Win32 API and C++.

I use this as my own reference when I'm developing my custom program/malware just for fun and try new things, experiment on how to create processes, file, how to handle TCP connection, etc.

I'm just sharing this after these collection have been too long in my archive so when I do need it and used it, I can search it here. I'm most probably forget some few here and there.

These codes are for educational purposes only, author assumes no responsibility for damages that occur as a result of improper or unethical use of this code.
